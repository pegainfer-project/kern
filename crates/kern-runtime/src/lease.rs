//! The lease shell. The pool decides on the host which pages and slots
//! a sequence gets and which bytes move; the runtime runs those moves on
//! the compute stream and the pool's remaps on a thread of its own.
//!
//! Every lease operation begins with `poll`: land the remaps the thread
//! has finished, their fresh chunks zeroed on the stream so a page or a
//! slot comes out of the pool as it did at load, then hand the thread the
//! plan the pool has pending, to run once both streams have passed
//! everything enqueued so far. One remap is in flight at a time; a
//! [`Denied::Remapping`] tells the caller to ask again once it lands. A
//! leased slot is zeroed on the stream (a fresh sequence's recurrent
//! state); a checkpoint, a restore and a fork move whole pages and whole
//! slots, as the pool's [`Copies`] say.
