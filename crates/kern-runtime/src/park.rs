//! The host tier shell: checkpoints parked in pinned DRAM and woken
//! back into leases. [`crate::host::Host`] decides where a checkpoint's
//! bytes go; this is the runtime running the copies.
//!
//! Two streams: every program and every pool copy runs on the compute
//! stream in order; the host tier's copies ([`Runtime::park`] out,
//! [`Runtime::wake`] in) run on a transfer stream, and the compute stream
//! never waits for them. The transfer stream starts each batch of copies
//! after everything the compute stream has enqueued; a parked checkpoint
//! stays held (its pages and slot out of the pool) until its copy has
//! landed, and a woken lease is a [`Waking`] until [`Runtime::awake`]
//! finds its copy landed, so no program can read pages still in flight.
//! Parking is two steps, [`Runtime::room`] then [`Runtime::park`], so a
//! caller parking several checkpoints as one unit can find room for all
//! of them before any byte moves.
