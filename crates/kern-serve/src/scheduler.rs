//! The kern scheduler: one tray, many sequences.
//!
//! Implements the pegainfer frontend's [`Scheduler`] contract — `submit`,
//! `step`, `metrics` — over a kern manifest driven by a [`Tray`] (one
//! runtime per GPU, in lockstep; `tray.rs` is the design). What the
//! manifest must speak is its [`Protocol`]: fills naming which buffer
//! carries the tokens, positions, slots and lengths of a call and which
//! output hands tokens back, and a `batch` on every program a step may
//! run — `groups` sequences of `rows` rows each. The scheduler picks a
//! forward by shape and never by name: a decode step and a speculative
//! round are the same motion — stage `rows` rows per sequence at its
//! position, run the forward that accepts `(b, rows)`, read the tokens it
//! hands each sequence, `count` of them when it says so — and differ only
//! in the rows the operator asked for (`--rows`, a shape the manifest
//! declares; the widest by default). A prompt goes through the forward
//! that takes one sequence of as many rows as fed, in chunks; when that
//! forward hands a token back (a hybrid GDN model, whose chunked kernels
//! must see every prompt token) every prompt token goes through it and
//! the first generated token comes from it, otherwise the last prompt
//! token is the first step's input. Without such a forward the prompt
//! goes through one-row steps, a token at a time — a row feeding its
//! prompt is a row like any other, whose outputs are dropped until the
//! last prompt token is in — or, when the manifest takes a run (a
//! `span`, see `tray.rs`), in every tray group the oldest sequence still
//! feeding its prompt feeds a run of up to `--chunk` of its tokens as
//! consecutive rows of the step, the run's last row handing its token
//! back; the runs of a step are one length, the shortest any of them can
//! feed, since the span var is one value for the tray. That is what a
//! decode-only tray manifest (K3 today) gets: correct, and slow without
//! the run.
//!
//! Policy, deliberately simple:
//! - prefill first: each step admits waiting requests (up to a token
//!   budget when there is a chunk forward) and prefills them one at a
//!   time, then runs one step over every running sequence;
//! - a request leases every KV page its worst case (`prompt + max_tokens`,
//!   plus `rows - 1` for the last step's rows past the end) needs at
//!   admission (`Tray::lease`, on the rank with the fewest rows, then
//!   pages),
//!   so a step never runs out of pages and nothing is ever preempted; the
//!   row drops with the sequence;
//! - batches are padded up to a bucket size — the same bucket on every
//!   rank of the tray, from the most loaded one — and each bucket's
//!   forward is CUDA-graph-captured once; padding rows write into a page
//!   the tray leases for them and nobody reads;
//! - greedy only: the manifest's `argmax` is the sampler. Non-greedy
//!   sampling params are logged once and served greedily;
//! - a speculative round is a forward of several rows per sequence whose
//!   `tokens` output is `[groups, rows]` and whose `count` output says how
//!   many of a sequence's the device accepted: the rows past the count
//!   land past the sequence's position and the next step overwrites them,
//!   the paged state's free rollback. Whether a round beats a plain step
//!   at a given batch size is the operator's call (`--rows`), not the
//!   scheduler's;
//! - prefix reuse: a finished sequence's KV lives on as snapshots
//!   (`Tray::checkpoint` / `retire`, indexed by token hash in a `Prefix`
//!   table keyed over the whole tray), and a new prompt starts from the
//!   longest snapshot holding a proper prefix of it (`Tray::lease_from`;
//!   prefill covers the rest). A paged-only manifest checkpoints every
//!   whole page as a sequence fills it — free, a shared page — so any
//!   earlier prompt or output is reusable at page granularity; a manifest
//!   with a recurrent state checkpoints only where a request ends (the
//!   finished sequence's state slots become the snapshot's, nothing is
//!   copied), so only a prompt that continues an earlier request's whole
//!   context hits. A `Busy` lease makes room and retries until it fits or
//!   nothing is left: the least recently hit snapshot is parked into the
//!   host tier (`--host-gib`: pinned DRAM per rank, `Tray::park`, all of
//!   its members' pieces or none; the coldest parked ones are dropped when
//!   it is full) or, without one, dropped. A prompt hitting a parked
//!   snapshot wakes it (`Tray::wake`): the copies ride the transfer
//!   streams and the request waits in `waking` until `Tray::awake` hands
//!   out the row, so no step queues behind them.
